# System Patterns

## Repository Structure

The repository is primarily a collection of Markdown files. These files are organized into directories based on topic. The top-level structure is:

- `docs/`: Contains documentation related to specific tools, technologies, or concepts.
- `cline/`: Contains information related to using cline.
- `memory-bank/`: Contains files for cline's memory bank.

## File Naming Conventions

Files should be named using lowercase letters and hyphens, following the `kebab-case` convention. For example: `git-commands.md`.

## Content Organization within Files

- Use Markdown headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) to structure content within each file.
- Use bullet points and numbered lists to organize information.
- Use code blocks to provide examples.
