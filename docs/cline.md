# Cline Guide

## Setup

1.  Create `.clinerules/` folder in the root of your project and add rules for your project.
2.  Create a `.clineignore` file in the root of your project and add paths to ignore.
3.  Create `memory-bank/` folder in the root of your project and add `projectBrief.md` files that you want to keep in memory.
4.  Ask Cline to `initialize memory bank`.

## Usage

- `follow your custom instructions` - Starting a task, this will instruct Cline to read the context files and continue where he left off.
- `initialize memory bank` - Start fresh.
- `update memory bank` - Full documentation review.
- Toggle Plan/Act modes as needed.
